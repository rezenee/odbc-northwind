My /etc/odbc.ini looks like 
[mydsn]
Driver      = MariaDB
Socket      = /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
Database    = northwind
Server      = localhost
Uid         = cs4430
Password    = cs4430
Port        = 3306

My /etc/odbcinst.ini looks like 
[MariaDB]
Description = ODBC Driver for MariaDB
Driver      = /usr/lib/libmaodbc.so
Fileusage   = 1

To run the program run make in the directory. Make sure you have mariadb-odbc installed.
Also note, I compile with -lm.

the package for the driver that I used is
yay -S mariadb-connector-odbc
for the odbc generic I used
pacman -S unixodbc
